# Build and run the host-side logic tests.
#
# These cover the pure headers, none of which needs an ESP32, an
# MCP23017 or a bee:
#
#   * include/gate_logic.h      — sensor debounce, the per-gate crossing state
#                                 machine, and the saturating counters;
#   * include/measurement_json.h — the exact bytes of the BLE measurement
#                                 characteristic, i.e. HiveHub's half of the
#                                 wire contract;
#   * include/idle_state.h      — the night-mode suspension deadline, including
#                                 the millis() rollover and the "HiveHub stopped
#                                 re-arming" case;
#   * include/bank_state.h      — the emitter-bank enable mask, whose mistakes
#                                 are eight gates that silently stop counting;
#   * include/device_name.h     — the advertised BLE name, whose address suffix
#                                 is how a person tells two counters apart;
#   * include/log_line.h        — the USB log's "whole lines or nothing" rule,
#                                 which keeps a stalled terminal from stalling
#                                 the gate sampler;
#   * include/poll_timing.h     — the poll-gap record that makes such a stall
#                                 visible, across pauses and micros() rollover.
#
# Everything hardware-facing stays in src/main.cpp and is still verified on the
# bench (see the IR_DEBUG console in the README).
#
#     ./test/run_tests.sh
#
# Exits non-zero if any check fails.
